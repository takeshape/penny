"""
An order is a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a shop. You can retrieve and update orders using the `Order` object.
Learn more about
[editing an existing order with the GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/order-editing).

Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the `Order` object by default. If you want to access older orders,
then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions). If your app is granted
access, then you can add the `read_all_orders` scope to your app along with `read_orders` or `write_orders`.
[Private apps](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/basic-http) are not affected by this change and are automatically granted the scope.

**Caution:** Only use this data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.

A **Fulfillment Service** is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships orders
on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and ship items
and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with Shopify integrations
include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new `FulfillmentService` on a store,
Shopify automatically creates a `Location` that's associated to the fulfillment service.
To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to
[Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps)
guide.

## Mutations

You can work with the `FulfillmentService` object with the
[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate),
[fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate),
and [fulfillmentServiceDelete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceDelete)
mutations.

## Hosted endpoints

Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that
Shopify can query on certain conditions.
These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the `callbackUrl` parameter
in the
[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate)
mutation.

- Shopify sends POST requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint
  to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests,
  if `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` is set to `true`.

  [As of the 2022-07 API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/legacy-fulfillment-api-deprecation),
  it's mandatory for a fulfillment service to follow a fulfillment order based workflow by
  having `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` set to `true`,
  hosting the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint, and acting on fulfillment requests and cancellations.

  For more information, refer to
  [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders,
  if `trackingSupport` is set to `true`.

  For more information, refer to
  [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-8-enable-tracking-support-optional).

  Fulfillment services can also update tracking information with the
  [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2) mutation,
  rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels,
  if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.

  For more information, refer to
  [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-9-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify-optional).

To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints
in your development store.

## Resources and webhooks

There are a variety of objects and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work.
To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the
[FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder),
[Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) and
[Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) objects and related mutations.
To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side,
besides awaiting calls to `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints,
fulfillment services can subscribe to the
[fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
and [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook)
webhooks.

  - Shopify queries the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels,
      if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.
  - Shopify uses the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint to send

An order that a merchant creates on behalf of a customer. Draft orders are useful for merchants that need to do the following tasks:

- Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere. When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
- Send invoices to customers to pay with a secure checkout link.
- Use custom items to represent additional costs or products that aren't displayed in a shop's inventory.
- Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
- Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
- Take pre-orders.
- Save an order as a draft and resume working on it later.

For Draft orders in multiple currencies `presentment_money` is the source of truth for what a customer is going to be charged and `shop_money` is an estimate of what the merchant might receive in their local currency.
