# TakeShape Deluxe ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Ecommerce Sample Project

The easiest way to know if a tool is right for you is to see it in action.

That's why we built the Deluxe sample project‚Äîa production-ready composable e-commerce experience that uses the most
popular modern API services and frontend technologies. Check out the store now at
https://deluxe-sample-project.vercel.app/.

This project has two major elements:

- The Next.js frontend
- The TakeShape project that composes the e-commerce services on the backend.

TakeShape's API Mesh functionality empowers e-commerce brands to manage their favorite API services in a single
interface, then generate a GraphQL API that combines all the functionality from those connected services. This generated
API can be consumed by any frontend to build any ecommerce experience for any sales channel.

This project will demonstrate how you can use TakeShape to build a modern e-commerce experience.

You can clone this repo with git to run the Next.js frontend locally
(`git clone https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-deluxe-sample-project`). To connect it to the unified e-commerce
backend that TakeShape provides, just deploy the pattern in the `.takeshape/pattern` directory.
[The instructions section of this README will teach you how to do that](#instructions).

## How it works

This repo contains two major elements:

- The TakeShape project that powers the composable e-commerce backend.
- The Next.js project that powers the headless storefront.

To get full use out of the Deluxe sample project, you'll have to configure both the TakeShape project and the Next.js
project.

Here's a deep-dive into both:

### The TakeShape project pattern

This starter's TakeShape project composes the following services into a unified GraphQL API:

- Shopify Admin and Storefront for customer data, product info and payment processing
- OpenID for identity management
- ReCAPTCHA for security
- Gorgias for customer support
- Klaviyo for newsletter subscriptions
- REVIEWS.io for product reviews
- Voucherify for customer loyalty rewards
- Ship Engine for shipping management

But TakeShape isn't just the composition layer for these services‚Äîit also enables functionality that can take most
headless e-commerce deployments to the next level:

- **TakeShape's [API Indexing](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/schema/api-indexing-guide/) speeds up product queries by
  over 50%‚Äîfrom 400ms to under 200ms‚Äîand enables product search on the frontend**
- **TakeShape's [ShapeDB](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/data/modeling) hosts some of the custom content used in this
  build.**

```

### The frontend stack

The frontend codebase was built with many features that are important for modern composable e-commerce storefronts,
including:

#### Frameworks, language and styling

To demonstrate TakeShape in the most popular use-case, here are the frameworks, language and styling options we went
with for this build:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build the pages and bundle the frontend up
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for user authentication
- [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) for plug-and-play components that are easy to customize
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for state management when querying the TakeShape project's
  API
- [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) for optimized component state management
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI prototyping

#### Testing

Testing is a crucial part of modern web development, and our suite of testing tools matches many of the most popular
stacks in the industry:

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for frontend end-to-end testing and API service mocking
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for error reporting and health monitoring
  [with their Next.js-specific SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/).
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for error checking and code formatting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for React component testing.
- [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/lighthouse-seo/) for SEO and browser performance metrics
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) for automated testing in github PRs

#### TakeShape's tools

We also used a few tools from TakeShape's ecosystem to simplify our workflow and improve the development process:

- [Next-Auth-All-Access](https://github.com/takeshape/next-auth-all-access#nextauthallaccess) ‚Äî Our NextAuth wrapper
  that provides JWKS-verifiable access tokens for third-party APIs.
- [@takeshape/cli](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/cli) ‚Äî Our CLI that makes linking a frontend project with a TakeShape
  project easy. The CLI empowers frontend developers to make updates to their TakeShape project schema, validate changes
  to the schema from the terminal, and generate graphql types from their schema for frontend frameworks like Apollo.
- [@takeshape/graphql-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@takeshape/graphql-validate) ‚Äî Our GraphQL query
  validation module that supports all graphql-cli options and makes writing queries from the frontend much less painful.
- [@takeshape/routing](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/routing/#:~:text=Routing%E2%80%8B,dynamic%20search%20or%20taxonomy%20pages)
  ‚Äî Our routing module, which has methods for generating URLs for image assets stored in TakeShape.

In the next section, you'll find a screenshot of the finished store's homepage.

## Instructions

Here are the steps for getting started with this project:

1. Create a TakeShape project using the pattern in this repo. This button will deploy the project for you:

<a href="https://app.takeshape.io/add-to-takeshape?repo=https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-deluxe-sample-project/tree/main/.takeshape/pattern"><img alt="Deploy To TakeShape" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1b580e3ce353d235bde0f376ca35b0fb26d685f3750a3013ae4b225dd3aaf344/68747470733a2f2f696d616765732e74616b6573686170652e696f2f32636363633832352d373062652d343331632d396261302d3130616233386563643361372f6465762f38653266376264612d306530382d346564652d613534362d3664663539626536613862622f4465706c6f79253230746f25323054616b65536861706525343032782e706e673f6175746f3d666f726d6174253243636f6d7072657373" width="205" height="38" data-canonical-src="https://images.takeshape.io/2cccc825-70be-431c-9ba0-10ab38ecd3a7/dev/8e2f7bda-0e08-4ede-a546-6df59be6a8bb/Deploy%20to%20TakeShape%402x.png?auto=format%2Ccompress" style="max-width:100%;"></a>

2. Generate an `anonymous` and a `webhook` TakeShape API key. You need these two API keys, and they must have different
   permissions scopes. Here's how to create them:

- Navigate to the **Settings** tab in your TakeShape project's dashboard.

- Select the **API Keys** option in the left sidebar.

- Select the **New API Key** button at the top-right of the page.

- Name the first API Key anything you want; just be sure to grant it `anonymous` permissions.

- Save the key somewhere. Later, you must either set it as the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_ANONYMOUS_API_KEY`
  environment variable in your frontend project's `.env.local` file, or set it as an environment variable in your
  hosting provider's UI.

- Do the same process, but this time create a key with `webhook` permissions. The environment variable for this key will
  be `TAKESHAPE_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`.

3. Get your TakeShape project's API Endpoint. Here's how:

- Navigate to the **Home** tab of your TakeShape project's dashboard in the web client. Scroll down to the **Useful
  Snippets** section, and copy the **API Endpoint** there.
- Save the endpoint somewhere. Later, you must either set it as the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_API_URL`
  environment variable in your frontend project's `.env.local` file, or set it as an environment variable in your
  hosting provider's UI.

4. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-deluxe-sample-project
```

4. Navigate to the project directory in your local terminal and run the `npm install` command to install all
   dependencies.

If you want to run this project locally, follow the instructions in the `.env.test` file.

The following instructions will help you configure all of the services this project uses.

### NextAuth and OpenID

This project uses NextAuth in combination with the `@takeshape/next-auth-all-access` package for user authentication. It
also uses OpenID for identity management. The following instructions will walk you through setting up OpenID as a
service provider in your TakeShape project, and configuring NextAuth with `@takeshape/next-auth-all-access`.

#### Setting up OpenID

1. In the **Home** tab of your TakeShape project, select **OpenID** from the list of services. You will be taken to the
   **OpenID** service configuration page.
   ![A screenshot of the Home tab in the deluxe sample project on TakeShape](/readme-images/home-tab-open-id-readme-images.png)

2. Add your store's URL to the **Issuer URL** field, and enter the same URL with
   `/api/auth/all-access/.well-known/openid-configuration` appended to the end of it in the **OpenID Configuration
   URL**.

   > Note: Your store URL should be the public-facing URL of your website, not necessarily your myshopify.com URL.

3. Copy the generated url in the **Audience** field and save it somewhere secure. You'll need it for your one of your
   project's environment variables.
4. Select the **Save** button at the top-right of the OpenID service page.

5. Now set up your environment variables. You can either do this in the `.env` file in your Next.js project's directory,
   or [in your hosting provider's UI](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

- Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_AUTH_AUDIENCE` variable to the generated **Audience** URL from your OpenID provider.
- Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_AUTH_ISSUER` variable to the same URL you provided for the **Issuer URL** field on your
  OpenID provider. This should be your store's URL.

#### Setting up NextAuth

To set up NextAuth, use our `@takeshape/next-auth-all-access` package to generate private keys:

```bash
npm i @takeshape/next-auth-all-access
```

```bash
npx @takeshape/next-auth-all-access generate-keys
```

You'll see three messages:

- "Add the following line to your .env file, this is your private key:"
- The generated private key. It should look like this:

```

```

- "Writing your JWKS file to `'./keys/jwks.json'`"

Paste the line containing your private key into your `.env.local` file. If you're deploying with Vercel or another
platform, add `NEXTAUTHOIDC_PRIVATE_KEY` to your environment variables, and set the value to the generated private key.

You should also have a new `keys` directory with a `jwks.json` file with generated properties. It should look similar to
this:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "n": "-V6bHaN66DSn7BYh97tmr0hnmXoASpGrZokQ",
      "e": "ABGA",
      "use": "sig",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "kid": "abcbf2c1ee7a6b2dc6564b783d334e32"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Shopify Admin and Shopify Storefront

> Warning! Connecting this project to a live Shopify store **WILL** enable real purchases. If you just want to play
> around without risking real charges,
> [set your store's payments to Test Mode](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments)
> and use [appropriately scoped Shopify API keys](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes). When testing purchases,
> always use
> [Shopify's accepted fake credit card information](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/test-orders-in-dev-stores).

This project uses Shopify for e-commerce functionality. These instructions assume you've already
[created a Shopify store](https://www.shopify.com/). You don't need to have Shopify Plus to use any of the features
described here.

Follow these instructions to connect your Shopify store's Admin and Storefront APIs to both your TakeShape project and
the frontend Next.js project.

1. [Create a Shopify store if you don't already have one](https://www.shopify.com/).

2. Navigate to your store's admin site by visiting `https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin`, substituting "your-store"
   with the name of your store.

3. Configure your Shopify checkout experience.

This project uses Shopify's checkout experience. That means when a customer is ready to purchase, they are redirected to
a checkout flow that Shopify generates. The only downside is, shopify's checkout flow will send users to your shopify
store, not your headless store, when they're done. To force Shopify's checkout experience to redirect to your headless
storefront, you must use [their Liquid templating language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). These instructions show
you how:

- In your store's admin UI, select the **‚öô Settings** button. A settings menu will appear. Select **Checkout** on the
  left.
  ![A screenshot of the Settings menu with Checkout selected.](/readme-images/checkout-settings-nav-readmie-images.png)

- Scroll down to the **Order status page** settings. In the **Additional Scripts** text area, add the following script.
  There are two URLs the order can possibly be redirected to. Be sure to add your store's root URL to the second one,
  under the `{% else %}`:

  ```
    {% if checkout.attributes.redirect_origin %}
    <script> window.location = "{{ checkout.attributes.redirect_origin }}/?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
    {% else %}
    <script> window.location = "https://your-shopify-store.com/?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
    {% endif %}
  ```

- **Save** your changes.

The following instructions will show you how to configure your checkout process to work with this headless store. To
configure these settings, stay in the **Checkout** section of the **Settings** menu in your store's admin UI.

- Under **Customer Accounts**, select **Accounts are optional**. This allows customers to create checkouts as guests.

- Under **Customer Contact Method**, select **Phone number or email**.

- The **Customer information** settings can be changed to suit your needs. This is how we have it configured in our
  build:

  - Full name: **Only require last name**
  - Company name: **Don't Include**
  - Address line 2 (apartment, unit, etc.): **Optional**
  - Shipping address phone number: **Don't include**

  ![A screenshot of our customer information settings](/readme-images/customer-information-readme-images.png)

- **Save** your changes.

> If you want to test this app without enabling real payments, it's best to set up test payments while you're in
> Shopify's admin UI.
> [Follow Shopify's instructions for setting up test payments in your store](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments).

4. Get your Storefront API keys.

- In the navigation on the left side of your store's admin page, select **Apps**. A dropdown window should appear.
  Select **‚öô App and Sales Channel Settings** as shown in the image below.

![The admin page in shopify](/readme-images/store-admin-page-readme-images.png)

- Select the **Develop apps for your store** button. On the next page, titled "App Development," select **Create an
  app** and name the app whatever you'd like.

  ![The Apps and Sales Channels page. Select Develop apps for your store.](/readme-images/admin-settings-page-readme-images.png)

  ![Select the Create an app button on the App development page.](/readme-images/create-app-button-readme-images.png)

- You'll be taken to your app's settings page. Under the Overview tab, you'll see "Select your scopes to get started."
  Select **Configure Storefront API scopes**.

  ![A screenshot of the app development page where you can select the Configure Storefront API scopes button.](/readme-images/configure-storefront-scopes-readme-images.png)

- Enable the following scopes:

  - `unauthenticated_write_checkouts`
  - `unauthenticated_read_checkouts`
  - `unauthenticated_write_customers`
  - `unauthenticated_read_customers`
  - `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`
  - `unauthenticated_read_selling_plans`

  ![A screenshot of the storefront access scopes page](/readme-images/storefront-scopes-page-readme-images.png)

Then select **Save** at the top right of the page.

- Now select the API credentials tab. You'll see a section titled **Access tokens**. Select the **Install app** button
  within this section (not the button at the top-right).
  ![A screenshot of the API credentials tab, where you can select the Install app button to install your app and enable the Storefront API.](/readme-images/access-tokens-install-app-readme-images.png)
- You'll be returned to your app's settings page, where you can select the "API Credentials" tab again. You will now see
  a **Storefront API access token**. Copy it and save it. You'll need it to configure Shopify Storefront in your
  TakeShape project.

![A screenshot of the Storefront APi access token section](/readme-images/storefront-api-access-token-readme-images.png)

#### Connecting the Shopify services to TakeShape

To use Shopify with this project, you'll need to connect your Shopify Admin API and Shopify Storefront API as two
separate services. The following instructions will help you connect your Shopify APIs to the deluxe sample project
pattern, but you can
[connect Shopify to any TakeShape project by following the Shopify guide in our docs](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/services/providers/shopify/).

##### Connecting Shopify Admin

- Navigate to your TakeShape project's dashboard and select the **Home** tab. Select the **Shopify** service.
- Add your store's myshopify.com URL to the **myshopify.com URL** field. The format of the URL is your store's name +
  myshopify.com. `https://your-shop.myshopify.com`

- Select **Save** and complete the setup flow in the Shopify browser tab that opens up. If you've already connected
  TakeShape to this shop before, you may not have to do anything on Shopify.

- After you complete the Shopify setup flow, you'll be taken to the API Indexing setup flow in TakeShape. Skip it. No
  further configuration is needed for Shopify Admin.

##### Connecting Shopify Storefront

- Navigate to the **Home** tab of your TakeShape project.

- Select the Shopify Storefront service. It will be a generic GraphQL service, with the GraphQL logo.

- In the **Endpoint** field, enter your store's Shopify Storefront endpoint. It will be of this format:

```
https://store-name.myshopify.com/api/2022-04/graphql.json
```

Here's what ours looked like when we set up this project in June of 2022:

```
https://deluxe-store.myshopify.com/api/2022-04/graphql.json
```

- For **Authentication Type**, select **Bearer Token**.

- In the **Header** field, enter `X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token`.
- In the **Token** field, enter the Storefront API access token you copied from your store's myshopify.com/admin page.

Now your Shopify store is configured for this project. The next section is about setting up reviews in your store with
REVIEWS.io.

## Deploying to production

> When deploying this project to production, be sure to replace all public placeholder assets.

### Choosing a hosting platform

When building this project, we chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the frontend.

[Vercel is the company that created Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and they have useful github workflow tools for
projects like this. We integrated
[their deploy preview functionality](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github) into our workflow, which
allowed Vercel to generate a preview build of the site for every pull request we created. That allowed us to see what
the PR's changes would look like in production before we merged them to our main branch.

To learn more about deploying with Vercel, [check out their comprehensive guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/for/web-applications/) is a popular alternative that you can also check out. They
offer [a similar deploy preview tool](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/).

## Development notes

- Be sure to follow the instructions in the `.env` and `.env.local-example` files included in this repo. Use `.env.test`
  to run the project locally on your machine. Rename `.env.local-example` to `.env.local` before pushing any changes to
  it.
- `storybook-addon-jotai` necessitates the graphql overrides
- `@babel/runtime` is required for issues with nested deps of `@takeshape/cli`'s codegen
- Components with state coming from localstorage via Jotai's `atomWithStorage` should be wrapped in the `<ClientOnly />`
  component. This prevents rendering mismatches and stale / incorrect info.
- Navigation data is loaded into an Apollo cache variable via `addApolloQueryCache`. Files in the `src/data` folder
  should define queries to get data that need to be fetched and cached during `getStaticProps` in order to prevent a
  flash of unloaded data in common high visibility components, like the navigation, footer, etc... Add to the file
  `src/services/apollo/addApolloQueryCache.ts` following the pattern there to get other common data.
- The Shopify store is configured to redirect after checkout via the "Additional scripts" field (see the
  [docs](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/status-tracking/customize-order-status#add-additional-scripts)) for
  the order status page and uses the `redirect_origin` attribute set at cart creation:
- Shopify **must** use the `2022-04` endpoint, like this:
  `https://shopify-shop-name.myshopify.com/admin/api/2022-04/graphql.json`

```erb
{% if checkout.attributes.redirect_origin %}
<script> window.location = "{{ checkout.attributes.redirect_origin }}/?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
{% else %}
<script> window.location = "https://your-shopify-store.com?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
{% endif %}
```

- Captcha can be disabled in the client by removing `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` from the env. The Takeshape API
  will still require Captcha unless the Captcha compose step and `"if": "$resolvers.recaptcha.success == true"` is
  removed from the relevant mutations in the project schema.
