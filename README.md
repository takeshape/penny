### The TakeShape project pattern

This starter project composes the following services into a unified GraphQL API:

- Shopify Admin and Storefront for customer data, product info and payment processing
- OpenID for identity management
- ReCAPTCHA for security
- Gorgias for customer support
- Klaviyo for newsletter subscriptions
- REVIEWS.io for product reviews
- Voucherify for customer loyalty rewards
- Ship Engine for shipping management

TakeShape is also providing performance and data services for the storefront:

- **TakeShape's [API Indexing](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/schema/api-indexing-guide/) speeds up product queries by
  10x and enables lighting fast product search on the frontend**
- **TakeShape's [ShapeDB](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/data/modeling) hosts some of the custom content used in this
  build.**

## Instructions

Here are the steps for getting started with this project:

1. Create a TakeShape project using the pattern in this repo. This button will deploy the project for you:

<a href="https://app.takeshape.io/add-to-takeshape?repo=https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-deluxe-sample-project/tree/main/.takeshape/pattern"><img alt="Deploy To TakeShape" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1b580e3ce353d235bde0f376ca35b0fb26d685f3750a3013ae4b225dd3aaf344/68747470733a2f2f696d616765732e74616b6573686170652e696f2f32636363633832352d373062652d343331632d396261302d3130616233386563643361372f6465762f38653266376264612d306530382d346564652d613534362d3664663539626536613862622f4465706c6f79253230746f25323054616b65536861706525343032782e706e673f6175746f3d666f726d6174253243636f6d7072657373" width="205" height="38" data-canonical-src="https://images.takeshape.io/2cccc825-70be-431c-9ba0-10ab38ecd3a7/dev/8e2f7bda-0e08-4ede-a546-6df59be6a8bb/Deploy%20to%20TakeShape%402x.png?auto=format%2Ccompress" style="max-width:100%;"></a>

2. Generate an `anonymous` and a `webhook` TakeShape API key. You need these two API keys, and they must have different
   permissions scopes. Here's how to create them:

- Navigate to the **Settings** tab in your TakeShape project's dashboard.

- Select the **API Keys** option in the left sidebar.

- Select the **New API Key** button at the top-right of the page.

- Name the first API Key anything you want; just be sure to grant it `anonymous` permissions.

- Save the key somewhere. Later, you must either set it as the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_ANONYMOUS_API_KEY`
  environment variable in your frontend project's `.env.local` file, or set it as an environment variable in your
  hosting provider's UI.

- Do the same process, but this time create a key with `webhook` permissions. The environment variable for this key will
  be `TAKESHAPE_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`.

3. Get your TakeShape project's API Endpoint. Here's how:

- Navigate to the **Home** tab of your TakeShape project's dashboard in the web client. Scroll down to the **Useful
  Snippets** section, and copy the **API Endpoint** there.

- Save the endpoint somewhere. Later, you must either set it as the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_API_URL`
  environment variable in your frontend project's `.env.local` file, or set it as an environment variable in your
  hosting provider.

4. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-deluxe-sample-project
```

5. Navigate to the project directory in your local terminal and run the `npm install` command to install all
   dependencies.

If you want to run this project locally, follow the instructions in the `.env.test` file.

The following instructions will help you configure all of the services this project uses.

### NextAuth and OpenID

This project uses NextAuth in combination with the `@takeshape/next-auth-all-access` package for user authentication. It
also uses OpenID for identity management. The following instructions will walk you through setting up OpenID as a
service provider in your TakeShape project, and configuring NextAuth with `@takeshape/next-auth-all-access`.

#### Setting up OpenID

1. In the **Home** tab of your TakeShape project, select **OpenID** from the list of services. You will be taken to the
   **OpenID** service configuration page.
   ![A screenshot of the Home tab in the deluxe sample project on TakeShape](/readme-images/home-tab-open-id-readme-images.png)

2. Add your store's URL to the **Issuer URL** field, and enter the same URL with
   `/api/auth/all-access/.well-known/openid-configuration` appended to the end of it in the **OpenID Configuration
   URL**.

   > Note: Your store URL should be the public-facing URL of your website, not necessarily your myshopify.com URL.

3. Copy the generated url in the **Audience** field and save it somewhere secure. You'll need it for your one of your
   project's environment variables.

4. Select the **Save** button at the top-right of the OpenID service page.

5. Now set up your environment variables. You can either do this in the `.env` file in your Next.js project's directory,
   or [in your hosting provider's UI](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

- Add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_AUTH_AUDIENCE` variable with the generated **Audience** URL from your OpenID provider.
- Add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAKESHAPE_AUTH_ISSUER` variable with the same URL you provided for the **Issuer URL** field on your
  OpenID provider. This should be your store's URL.

#### Setting up NextAuth

Use our `@takeshape/next-auth-all-access` package to create and sign an access token for your logged-in users.

To generate your keypair, use the following command from the root of your project repo and follow the printed
instructions.

```bash
npx @takeshape/next-auth-all-access generate-keys
```

You will then need to follow these steps:

1. Add the variable `ALLACCESS_PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key to your `.env.local` file and to your hosting
   provider's environment.

2. Commit the `./keys/jwks.json` file to your repo, push, and build. Your key will need to be web accessible at the URL
   you configured in TakeShape before authentication will work.

### Shopify Admin and Shopify Storefront

> Warning! Connecting this project to a live Shopify store **WILL** enable real purchases. If you just want to play
> around without risking real charges,
> [set your store's payments to Test Mode](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments)
> and use [appropriately scoped Shopify API keys](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes). When testing purchases,
> always use
> [Shopify's accepted fake credit card information](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/test-orders-in-dev-stores).

This project uses Shopify for e-commerce functionality. These instructions assume you've already
[created a Shopify store](https://www.shopify.com/). You don't need to have Shopify Plus to use any of the features
described here.

Follow these instructions to connect your Shopify store's Admin and Storefront APIs to both your TakeShape project and
the frontend Next.js project.

1. [Create a Shopify store if you don't already have one](https://www.shopify.com/).

2. Navigate to your store's admin site by visiting `https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin`, substituting "your-store"
   with the name of your store.

3. Configure your Shopify checkout experience.

This project uses Shopify's checkout experience. That means when a customer is ready to purchase, they are redirected to
a checkout flow that Shopify generates. The only downside is, shopify's checkout flow will send users to your shopify
store, not your headless store, when they're done. To force Shopify's checkout experience to redirect to your headless
storefront, you must use [their Liquid templating language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). These instructions show
you how:

- In your store's admin UI, select the **‚öô Settings** button. A settings menu will appear. Select **Checkout** on the
  left.
  ![A screenshot of the Settings menu with Checkout selected.](/readme-images/checkout-settings-nav-readmie-images.png)

- Scroll down to the **Order status page** settings. In the **Additional Scripts** text area, add the following script.
  There are two URLs the order can possibly be redirected to. Be sure to add your store's root URL to the second one,
  under the `{% else %}`:

  ```
    {% if checkout.attributes.redirect_origin %}
    <script> window.location = "{{ checkout.attributes.redirect_origin }}/?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
    {% else %}
    <script> window.location = "https://your-shopify-store.com/?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
    {% endif %}
  ```

- **Save** your changes.

The following instructions will show you how to configure your checkout process to work with this headless store. To
configure these settings, stay in the **Checkout** section of the **Settings** menu in your store's admin UI.

- Under **Customer Accounts**, select **Accounts are optional**. This allows customers to create checkouts as guests.

- Under **Customer Contact Method**, select **Phone number or email**.

- The **Customer information** settings can be changed to suit your needs. This is how we have it configured in our
  build:

  - Full name: **Only require last name**
  - Company name: **Don't Include**
  - Address line 2 (apartment, unit, etc.): **Optional**
  - Shipping address phone number: **Don't include**

  ![A screenshot of our customer information settings](/readme-images/customer-information-readme-images.png)

- **Save** your changes.

> If you want to test this app without enabling real payments, it's best to set up test payments while you're in
> Shopify's admin UI.
> [Follow Shopify's instructions for setting up test payments in your store](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments).

4. Get your Storefront API keys.

- In the navigation on the left side of your store's admin page, select **Apps**. A dropdown window should appear.
  Select **‚öô App and Sales Channel Settings** as shown in the image below.

![The admin page in shopify](/readme-images/store-admin-page-readme-images.png)

- Select the **Develop apps for your store** button. On the next page, titled "App Development," select **Create an
  app** and name the app whatever you'd like.

  ![The Apps and Sales Channels page. Select Develop apps for your store.](/readme-images/admin-settings-page-readme-images.png)

  ![Select the Create an app button on the App development page.](/readme-images/create-app-button-readme-images.png)

- You'll be taken to your app's settings page. Under the Overview tab, you'll see "Select your scopes to get started."
  Select **Configure Storefront API scopes**.

  ![A screenshot of the app development page where you can select the Configure Storefront API scopes button.](/readme-images/configure-storefront-scopes-readme-images.png)

- Enable the following scopes:

  - `unauthenticated_write_checkouts`
  - `unauthenticated_read_checkouts`
  - `unauthenticated_write_customers`
  - `unauthenticated_read_customers`
  - `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`
  - `unauthenticated_read_selling_plans`
  - `unauthenticated_read_product_inventory`
  - `unauthenticated_read_product_tags`

  ![A screenshot of the storefront access scopes page](/readme-images/storefront-scopes-page-readme-images.png)

Then select **Save** at the top right of the page.

- Now select the API credentials tab. You'll see a section titled **Access tokens**. Select the **Install app** button
  within this section (not the button at the top-right).
  ![A screenshot of the API credentials tab, where you can select the Install app button to install your app and enable the Storefront API.](/readme-images/access-tokens-install-app-readme-images.png)
- You'll be returned to your app's settings page, where you can select the "API Credentials" tab again. You will now see
  a **Storefront API access token**. Copy it and save it. You'll need it to configure Shopify Storefront in your
  TakeShape project.

![A screenshot of the Storefront APi access token section](/readme-images/storefront-api-access-token-readme-images.png)

#### Connecting the Shopify services to TakeShape

To use Shopify with this project, you'll need to connect your Shopify Admin API and Shopify Storefront API as two
separate services. The following instructions will help you connect your Shopify APIs to the deluxe sample project
pattern, but you can
[connect Shopify to any TakeShape project by following the Shopify guide in our docs](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/services/providers/shopify/).

##### Connecting Shopify Admin

- Navigate to your TakeShape project's dashboard and select the **Home** tab. Select the **Shopify** service.
- Add your store's myshopify.com URL to the **myshopify.com URL** field. The format of the URL is your store's name +
  myshopify.com. `https://your-shop.myshopify.com`

- Select **Save** and complete the setup flow in the Shopify browser tab that opens up. If you've already connected
  TakeShape to this shop before, you may not have to do anything on Shopify.

- After you complete the Shopify setup flow, you'll be taken to the API Indexing setup flow in TakeShape. Skip it. No
  further configuration is needed for Shopify Admin.

##### Connecting Shopify Storefront

- Navigate to the **Home** tab of your TakeShape project.
- Select the Shopify Storefront service. It will be a generic GraphQL service, with the GraphQL logo.
- In the **Endpoint** field, enter your store's Shopify Storefront endpoint. It will be of this format:

```
https://[STORE_NAME].myshopify.com/api/2022-04/graphql.json
```

Here's what ours looked like when we set up this project in June of 2022:

```
https://deluxe-store.myshopify.com/api/2022-04/graphql.json
```

- For **Authentication Type**, select **Bearer Token**.
- In the **Header** field, enter `X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token`.
- In the **Token** field, enter the Storefront API access token you copied from your store's myshopify.com/admin page.

You will also need to add your Shopify Storefront information to your `.env`. This is all public information, and can be
included in the `.env` file that is checked into the repo.

Add or update the lines `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_URL` in your `.env`
file.

Now your Shopify store is configured for this project.

### reCAPTCHA

The following section describes how to connect reCAPTCHA to your Deluxe Sample Project pattern in TakeShape using a
generic REST provider. To learn how to connect ReCAPTCHA to any TakeShape project,
[check out our docs on using a generic REST service](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/services/providers/rest).

> Don't want to use captcha? Captcha can be disabled in the client by removing `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` from the
> env. The Takeshape API will still require Captcha unless the Captcha compose step and
> `"if": "$resolvers.recaptcha.success == true"` is removed from the relevant mutations in the project schema.
> [Check out our docs on editing a TakeShape project schema](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/schema/editing).

> Because reCAPTCHA is tied to a specific host in the Google settings you will either need to use a custom domain and
> allow a wildcard subdomain for your preview builds, e.g., `*.mysite.com` allows `preview-acbiou43891239.mysite.com` or
> use an environment that disables recaptcha for your preview builds and remove the step above from your TakeShape
> project schema.

1. First, get your **Site Secret** from reCAPTCHA. If you need to create an account,
   [you can visit Google's ReCAPTCHA site registration page here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create).

  value for the **Token** field.

- Select the **Save** button at the top-right of the page.

### Gorgias

The following section describes how to connect Gorgias to your Deluxe Sample Project pattern in TakeShape. To learn how
to connect Gorgias to any TakeShape project,
[check out our REST provider docs](https://app.takeshape.io/docs/services/providers/rest). Using our generic REST
provider, you can connect most arbitrary REST APIs, including Gorgias.

1. You'll need your Gorgias API Endpoint, email address, and a Password API Key. Gorgias uses **Basic Auth**, which
   takes a username and password. Your username will be your Gorgias account email address, and your password will be a
   generated key from Gorgias.

- Navigate to your Gorgias dashboard and select the three dots at the top-left. The button will be labeled **Ticket** if
  you're in the Ticket view of the dashboard, but will change its label based on which view you're in. In the drop-down
  menu that appears, select **Settings**. You should be taken to the Settings view.

  ![A screenshot of the dropdown that appears when you select the **Ticket** button.](/readme-images/gorgias/tickets-settings-gorgias.png)

- In the **Authentication Type** field, ensure **Basic Auth** is selected.

- Under **Authentication**, add your email address in the **Username** field, and your API Key in the **Password**
  field.

- Select the **Save** button at the top-right of the page.

## Sentry

To use Sentry with this project, you need your project's
[Data Source Name](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/), as well as your sentry org slug and
project name.

> If you don't want to use Sentry do not set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable and it will not be
> loaded.

1. Find your Sentry DSN.

- Log into Sentry, and select your project. If you don't have a sentry project ready, create a Next.js project.

- Select **Settings** in the sidebar on the left, and scroll down to select **Client Keys (DSN)**. You will see the
  **Client Keys** panel.

- Save your DSN. You can set it in your `.env.local` or your hosting provider's UI as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`
  variable.

2. Find your sentry org slug.

- Head to **Settings**, then **General Settings**. At the top of the page you should see **Organization Slug**. Copy the
  value there.

- Set this value in your `.env.local` or your hosting provider's UI as the `SENTRY_ORG` variable.

3. Find your sentry project name.

- Head to **Settings**, then **Projects**. You'll see a list of projects. Select the Next.js project you want to use.

- Under the **Project Details** section on the next page, you'll see a **Name** field. Copy that value.

- Set the value from the **Name** field to the `SENTRY_PROJECT` variable in your `.env.local` or your hosting provider's
  UI.

## Multipass

For Shopify Plus users, this project supports sign in with Google, in addition to the regular Shopify sign in. To set it
up you need to provide the secret env vars `SHOPIFY_MULTIPASS_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
set the public env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_USE_MULTIPASS='true'`. Because we're using
[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.com) it's very easy to support almost any identity provider via a simple import in
`pages/api/[...nextauth].ts` and following the configuration instructions from Next Auth for that provider.

### Important!

Because of how the Google OAuth2 service works, you cannot use wildcard callback urls. This precludes the easy use of
Google auth in Vercel preview environments, which use dynamic URLs. It is recommended you unset
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_USE_MULTIPASS` for preview environments and configure it on a case-by-case basis.

### Other environment variables

1. Copy the `.env.local-example` file to `.env.local` and follow the instructions.
2. Copy the `.env-example` file, overwriting the `.env` file, and follow the instructions.

## Type generation

Your project is configured to generate types for the GraphQL APIs in use. Run `npm run graphql:typegen` before running
the site locally to generate query-specific types. This is a big advantage of the TakeShape GraphQL mesh ‚Äî you will have
your queries and responses fully typed, and can develop efficiently and safely.

## Deploying to production

> When deploying this project to production, be sure to replace all public placeholder assets.

### Choosing a hosting platform

When building this project, we chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the frontend.

[Vercel is the company that created Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and they have useful github workflow tools for
projects like this. We integrated
[their deploy preview functionality](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github) into our workflow, which
allowed Vercel to generate a preview build of the site for every pull request we created. That allowed us to see what
the PR's changes would look like in production before we merged them to our main branch.

To learn more about deploying with Vercel, [check out their comprehensive guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/for/web-applications/) is a popular alternative that you can also check out. They
offer [a similar deploy preview tool](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/).

## GitHub Actions

If you are using the included workflows you will get a great CI process, that includes:

- Unit tests on every PR
- Cypress E2E Testing on every PR
- Storybook deploys and testing with Chromatic
- Automated Lighthouse scores on every PR and on production deploys

### IMPORTANT

If you use the automated Lighthouse (Production) workflow, you must add the following to your Vercel
`Ignored Build Step` settings, otherwise you'll end up with an infinite prod deploy loop:

In `Project Settings > Git` add to `Ignored Build Strp` this command:

```
bash scripts/ignore-build.sh
```

### IMPORTANT - Development notes

- Components with state coming from localstorage via Jotai's `atomWithStorage` should be wrapped in the `<ClientOnly />`
  component. This prevents rendering mismatches and stale / incorrect info.

- The Shopify store is configured to redirect after checkout via the "Additional scripts" field (see the
  [docs](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/status-tracking/customize-order-status#add-additional-scripts)) for
  the order status page and uses the `redirect_origin` attribute set at cart creation:

- Shopify **must** use the `2022-07` endpoint, like this:  
  Admin API: `https://shopify-shop-name.myshopify.com/admin/api/2022-07/graphql.json`  
  Storefront API: `https://deluxe-sample-project.myshopify.com/api/2022-07/graphql.json`

```erb
{% if checkout.attributes.redirect_origin %}
<script> window.location = "{{ checkout.attributes.redirect_origin }}/?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
{% else %}
<script> window.location = "https://your-shopify-store.com?shopify_checkout_action=success"; </script>
{% endif %}
```

- Captcha can be disabled in the client by removing `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` from the env. The Takeshape API
  will still require Captcha unless the Captcha compose step and `"if": "$resolvers.recaptcha.success == true"` is
  removed from the relevant mutations in the project schema.
